# CourseProject

In this project, some codes coded during my undergraduate period were presented. And all the interface and comments were written in Chinese. If somebody is interested in this project and wants to extend this project, please contact me by email for more help.

MatMecCal(Materials Mechanics Calculator) is an open source program to handle the force analysis of simple beam and cantilever beam based on MATLAB. It has following features:

- Object: simple beam and cantilever beam
- Force Type:  Force(Concentrated or uniformly distributed) and Couple(Concentrated)
- Problem Type: Statically determinate problem and Statically indeterminate problem
- Section Type:  Rectangle or Circular or Annular or I-type
- GUI(Graphic User Interface) in Chinese
